Q1. What happens if users choose “Cancel”?

If the user selects "Cancel," the program will display a message indicating that the user chose Cancel. This is handled in the code with the condition else if (choice == 2).


Q2: How to customize the options for users?

To customize the options, you can modify the options array in the showOptionDialog method. For example, if you only want two options "Yes" and "No", you can do:
String[] options = {"Yes", "No"};
Or if you want to use "I do" and "I don't":
String[] options = {"I do", "I don't"};
